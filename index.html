      <h1>Portfolio of Samuel Ramirez-Navas. </h1>      
      <p>My name is Samuel Ramirez-Navas.I've been boxing for 5 years and I've been doing Muy Thai, kickboxing, and Jiu Jitsu for the past 2 years.Apart from fighting I like computer science too.My favroite part of computer science is programmng robots and fixing game or website mechanics.One of my strengths of several is that I will be determined to fix a problem while knowing when enough is enough and its time to move on and come back later.Another thing that I like about CS is that I get to collaborate with others to fix a problem.</p>

        <p>This is the final game I developed using p5.js.This game is similar to flappy bird and works about the same but i've added levels that change the scenery of the background and difficulty.
        This game shows that I can make a fully functional game that demonstrates my ability to make and call different functions that help make an addictive and enjoyable game like this one. </p>
